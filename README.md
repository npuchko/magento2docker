  - var/www/html
  - home/magento
  - /root/.composer/cache

## How to start using Blackfire
[Blackfire Profiler](https://blackfire.io/docs/introduction) is a PHP profiler and automated performance testing tool. It enables you to investigate performance issues in very simple way, just install a browser extension and press the button. You will get granular performance report to measure CPU, IO, Memory, Network, etc.
Profiling with Blackfire is on-demand. This means that Blackfire adds no overhead for your end users, which makes it safe to use in production.

### Get your Blackfire credentials
Blackfire provides you a free account "Hack" which allows you to run profiles on your development environment. 
 - Create account and login here: https://blackfire.io/login
 - Install Browser Extension https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/chrome
 - Go to the page https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/docker
   - Define these environment variables from this page on the host system (OSX)
   - You can save them permanently by putting them into ~/.bash_profile file
 - Recreate containers by using command `make up`
